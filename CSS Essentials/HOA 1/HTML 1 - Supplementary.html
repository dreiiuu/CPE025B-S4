        <p>
            I am currently studying <span class="accent">Python</span> and <span class="accent">C#</span>

            Additionally, I am learning <span class="accent">German</span>, <span class="accent">French</span>, 
            and <span class="accent">Chinese</span> to expand my communication skills for international collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also exploring other fields little by little, including <span class="accent">Law</span>, 
            <span class="accent">Nursing</span>, <span class="accent">Culinary Arts</span>, 
            <span class="accent">Accounting</span>, and <span class="accent">Civil and Architectural Design</span>. 
            These small ideas allow me to connect concepts from other areas to technology and project development.
